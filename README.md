# ai-games

With this repository, our aim is to make people enjoy coding AI agents (currently for different games). This started as a fun project to collect all the games and make AI agents to solve them but soon realized everyone might enjoy participating in the project.

Each game contains *player.py* which is the AI agent that plays the game. Please feel free to build your own AI bot by modifying *player.py*.

Pull requests/Contributions to the project and hence the community are welcome by adding/suggesting new games or improving existing agents. 

## Steps to run
```
git clone https://github.com/Code-Score/ai-games.git
pip install -r ai-games/requirements.txt
cd ai-games/<game>
python run.py
```

All the citations have been linked in run.py of the corresponding game.
